## How to Use
This work routine helps alleviate burnout by spacing out chunks of work time with small breaks.
Each cycle consists of alternating work and break time blocks. (By default, it is 20 minutes of work, followed by 10 minutes of break.) The very last break block is a longer break block. (By default, the long break is 20 minutes, with 3 iterations per cycle).
